# Number-Guessing-Game

Internship: Python Developer
Company: NOVANECTAR SERVICES PVT. LTD.

# Project Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a simple and interactive Python project where the system randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the user attempts to guess it.
After each guess, the program provides feedback — telling the user whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct — and tracks the number of attempts.

This project emphasizes user input handling, random number generation, conditional logic, and iterative loops in Python.


# Outcome
Successfully developed a fully functional and user-friendly number guessing game.

Strengthened understanding of Python fundamentals like loops (while), conditionals (if-else), and the random module.

Enhanced skills in designing simple, interactive CLI (Command Line Interface) applications.

# Features
Random number selection using the random.randint() function.

Continuous guessing loop until the correct number is guessed.

Feedback provided ("Too high" / "Too low") after each attempt.

Counting and displaying the number of tries.

# Technologies Used
Python 3

# Challenges Faced
Implementing the logic for repeated guesses while maintaining clean code structure.

Managing invalid inputs (non-integer values) — understanding the need for input validation.

Ensuring that feedback after every guess is clear and encouraging for the user.

# Conclusion
The Number Guessing Game project was a great way to apply Python programming concepts in a fun and interactive way.
This hands-on task improved my control over loops, conditions, and user-friendly input/output handling.
I am grateful to NOVANECTAR SERVICES PVT. LTD. for the opportunity to learn and grow through this internship.
